## General Information

-   **Background:** The project is based on accessing the credit risk of the consumer finance company, which carries the main business of lending various types of loans to urban customers. So critical in making loan approval decisions—this is to minimize financial loss on the part of the company under different scenarios based on the profile of the applicant.
-   **Business Problem:** The key purpose of it is to find a pattern which will then indicate whether a person is going to defaulter on their loan or not, so that such a person may then be helped to make better decisions, for example, that the loan may not be granted, the loan of a reduced amount is granted, or the loan is granted at a higher interest rate for a risky applicant.
-   **Dataset:** The `loan.csv` data set includes complete loan data for all loans issued during the period from 2007 to 2011. For further historical application details, there is the information on who defaulted on loans. It gives a data dictionary in `Data_Dictionary.xlsx`.

## Conclusions

-   **Conclusion 1:** The proportion of defaulters in the loan applicants is high; hence, adequate risk assessment should be ensured.
-   **Conclusion 2:** The most prominent influencing variable of probability of default is the loan amount and interest rate.
-   **Conclusion 3:** Some of the consumer characteristics, for example, income and tenure of employment are highly correlated and are related to the probability of the loan default.
-   **Conclusion 4:** The insights may help in developing a risk assessment model to predict and hence mitigate possible loan defaults.
